### Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* List Comprehensions
* Dictionary Comprehensions
* Nested Comprehensions
and
* Parsing CSV data
* Create a List Comprehension
* Create a Dictionary Comprehension

## Normal Mode

Implement these List and Dictionary Comprehensions, each as a function:

  * Remove all vowels from this sentence `List Comprehensions are the Greatest!`
  * Create a list of Water Temps for each day with the data from `buoy.csv`.
  * Convert the Water Temps from a string to a float
  * Convert the Water Temps from Celsius to Fahrenheit rounded to an int
  * Create a dictionary with Date as the key and Wave Height as the value
  * Using the following dictionary:
  ```
{'Gale': {'Homework 1': 88, 'Homework 2': 76},
 'Jordan': {'Homework 1': 92, 'Homework 2': 87},
 'Peyton': {'Homework 1': 84, 'Homework 2': 77},
 'River': {'Homework 1': 85, 'Homework 2': 91}}
```
    Create a nested comprehension to get the average of the Homework 1 grades.

## Hard Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Normal Mode**:

  * Convert each Date in normal mode (bouy.csv) to its numerical day of the week,
    then create a list of values for each day of the week
  * Using the previous list of values make the average for each statistic per day.
  * Write a function that can take a dictionary of bouy data and return the best weekend to take a trip. Include the criteria
  as to how it chooses the best weekend.
 
## Dataset

* buoy.csv

## Notes

In order to change the Date to its numerical day of the week, you will need
to use `defaultdict` with the `datetime` and `calendar` modules. This will need
to be done as a function, not a Comprehension
